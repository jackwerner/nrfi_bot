Dylan Cease officially finalizes his seven-year, $210M deal with Toronto. Blue Jays rotation looking stacked with Cease, Gausman, Bieber, and Berríos. That's a serious playoff-caliber staff if they can stay healthy.
Let me search for the most recent MLB news to find a current story for the tweet.
Cody Ponce, last year's KBO MVP, just signed a three-year, $30 million deal with the Blue Jays. Interesting gamble on a guy who was one of MLB's worst pitchers in 2021 before reinventing himself in Korea.
Cedric Mullins just signed a one-year, $7M deal with the Rays. Tampa looking to boost their outfield production after Mullins put up solid numbers but struggled with consistency the past two seasons.
Emilio Pagán returning to the Reds on a two-year, $20M deal. Cincinnati bringing back their successful closer from last season makes sense given how thin the relief market's getting after Helsley and Iglesias signings.
World Series hero Miguel Rojas returning to Dodgers on a one-year, $5.5M deal for what will be his final MLB season. After 2026, he's set to transition into a front office and player development role with LA.
Devin Williams agrees to three-year deal with Mets, but they're still interested in re-signing Edwin Díaz. Williams saved 18 games for Yankees after being traded from Brewers and is open to setup role. Mets building what could be a dominant bullpen.
Braves bring back Raisel Iglesias on a one-year, $16 million deal while also trading for Mauricio Dubon from Houston. Atlanta getting their offseason moves going early after missing the playoffs last season.
