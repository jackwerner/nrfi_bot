Andrés Muñoz quietly putting together one of the most dominant relief seasons ever with that 0.00 ERA and 17 saves for Seattle. When a closer is this automatic it completely changes how you manage the late innings.
Tarik Skubal just set the record for most strikeouts in a Maddux with 13 Ks against Cleveland. When a pitcher throws a complete game shutout under 100 pitches AND sets a record, you have to appreciate the artistry even if you're not a Tigers fan.

Shane Bieber's comeback hitting another roadblock with that elbow soreness is tough to watch. Guy was finally getting close to returning after surgery and now has to be scratched from his rehab start - the mental grind of these setbacks must be brutal.
Burnes needing Tommy John is a brutal blow for the D-backs playoff hopes. Guy was their ace and now they're looking at a full season without him next year too. Starting to feel like every top pitcher is just one start away from TJ these days.
