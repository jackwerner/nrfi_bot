Josh Naylor just locked in with the Mariners on a five-year, $92.5 million deal. First big signing of the offseason after he provided that spark down the stretch hitting .299 with 9 homers in 54 games for Seattle.
Michael King drawing serious interest from Marlins after posting a 2.93 ERA in 53 starts since moving to the rotation. His 2025 season was shortened by nerve and knee injuries, but that strikeout rate still makes him one of the more intriguing arms on the market.
Taylor Ward headed to Baltimore as Orioles trade former top prospect Grayson Rodriguez to Angels. Ward brings veteran outfield presence but O's giving up four years of team control for a rental with just one season left before free agency.
Raisel Iglesias signs one-year, $16 million deal with Angels after posting 1.25 ERA in second half of 2025. Still has elite stuff at 35 and should stabilize a bullpen that struggled with late leads last season.
Kazuma Okamoto and Kona Takahashi just got posted for MLB free agency, joining Munetaka Murakami and Tatsuya Imai from NPB. Four Japanese stars hitting the market at once is going to make this offseason way more interesting than expected.
Mets and Rangers just swapped Marcus Semien for Brandon Nimmo in a rare star-for-star trade. Rangers get their outfield upgrade while Mets fill that second base hole they've been trying to address since the deadline.
Cardinals trading Sonny Gray to Red Sox for Fitts and Clarke plus $20M cash. Gray finally agreed to waive his no-trade after saying in September he'd "definitely consider" trades as St. Louis leans into rebuilding. Makes sense for both sides.
Paul Skenes received a record $3.4 million from the pre-arbitration bonus pool after his dominant rookie season with the Pirates. Guy's getting paid before he even hits arbitration.
