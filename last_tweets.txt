Spencer Schwellenbach tossed his first career complete game yesterday as Braves beat Brewers 6-2. Nine Ks, no walks, and only five hits allowed. Dude's worked at least six innings in seven straight starts now. 
Giants losing Matt Chapman to a hand injury is a big blow. He's been their best position player with 12 homers and elite defense at third. Sprained ligaments in three fingers could keep him out until after the All-Star break. 
Dodgers' Ohtani threw 44 pitches over three simulated innings yesterday, and Roberts now says there's a "north of zero" chance he pitches before the All-Star break. 
Jacob Misiorowski took a no-hitter into the 6th in his MLB debut before exiting with calf cramping. Touched 102 mph with his fastball and threw 14 pitches over 100 mph against the Cardinals.
