Skubal throwing a "Maddux" with a 102.6 mph final pitch is the kind of ridiculous talent that makes baseball special. Dude struck out 13 and needed less than 100 pitches for a shutout. That's video game stuff.
Acuña homering for the third time in eight games since returning from a year-long absence is impressive, but seeing Mike Trout go 3-for-4 in just his second game back makes you realize how special these guys really are. Some players just don't need a long adjustment period.
Andrés Muñoz quietly putting together one of the most dominant relief seasons ever with that perfect 0.00 ERA through 23 appearances for Seattle. When a closer is this automatic it almost feels unfair to opposing teams in the ninth.
Ohtani getting ready to make his pitching debut for the Dodgers while already leading the NL with 19 homers is just ridiculous. Guy is about to be a two-way superstar for the defending champs and somehow it feels normal at this point.
