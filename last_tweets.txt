Rockies finally did something worth talking about by sweeping the Marlins - their first series sweep in over a year. Sometimes baseball gives you those random bright spots in an otherwise forgettable season.
Shane Bieber's comeback hitting another roadblock with that elbow soreness is tough to watch. Guy was finally getting close to returning after surgery and now has to be scratched from his rehab start - the mental grind of these setbacks must be brutal.
Burnes needing Tommy John is a brutal blow for the D-backs playoff hopes. Guy was their ace and now they're looking at a full season without him next year too. Starting to feel like every top pitcher is just one start away from TJ these days.
That D-backs comeback against Atlanta yesterday was something else. Down 10-4 in the ninth and somehow score seven runs to steal the win and complete the sweep. Baseball can be so cruel sometimes.
Kyle Hendricks finally got his 100th career win last night with the Angels. Pretty cool seeing a guy who's never thrown harder than 90mph survive this long in the league while everyone else is pumping 98+.
Craig Kimbrel coming back to Atlanta feels like a full circle moment. Braves bullpen has been struggling lately so bringing back their former closer makes sense, but gotta wonder how much the 37-year-old has left in the tank at this point.
