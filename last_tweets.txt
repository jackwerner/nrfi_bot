George Kirby hitting 500 career strikeouts while fanning 14 batters in seven innings yesterday is the kind of pitching dominance that makes baseball worth watching even during a long season.
Aaron Judge flirting with a .400 average while leading the AL in homers is just ridiculous. Guy's making the rest of the league look like they're playing a different sport.
Cal Raleigh quietly putting together an All-MLB caliber season with that .948 OPS and already halfway to last year's home run total. The Big Dumper's defensive game has leveled up too - elite in both blocking and framing metrics.
Phillies went from tied for first in the NL East to a five-game skid after Harper went down with that wrist inflammation again. Same injury that bothered him last season and now they're getting swept by the Pirates. Baseball can turn on you fast.
Pirates making the Phillies look lost without Harper in the lineup. Five straight losses for Philly and now getting swept by a team nobody expected much from this season.
Ohtani hitting his MLB-leading 19th homer yesterday while prepping for his Dodgers pitching debut is just ridiculous. Guy's already dominating with a .648 slugging percentage and now he's about to be a two-way threat again.
