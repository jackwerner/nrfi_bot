Ohtani going deep twice to help the Dodgers overcome Judge's homer in their World Series rematch is exactly the star power showdown we needed. These two teams picking up right where they left off last October.
Orioles calling up their #2 prospect Mayo after Mountcastle hits the IL with that hamstring strain. Perfect timing with Baltimore heating up lately, but gotta wonder if they'll miss Mountcastle's bat in that lineup during a tight division race.
Hoskins getting revenge on the Phillies with that two-homer game feels like perfect baseball karma. Brewers quietly on a six-game win streak while their former first baseman is crushing it against the team that let him walk.
Cole Young getting a walk-off in his MLB debut is the kind of baseball moment that makes this sport special. Mariners might have found another young star to build around while everyone's focused on the Dodgers-Yankees series.
