Carlos Rodón is quietly putting together a dominant stretch with his fifth straight win yesterday. Six innings of two-hit ball to complete the sweep against Texas shows why the Yankees rotation might be the most underrated weapon in baseball right now.
Acuña homering on the first pitch of his return is the most Acuña thing ever. Braves might finally get their season back on track with him in the lineup after that rough stretch they've been going through.
Twins quietly becoming the hottest team in baseball with Ty France's clutch ninth-inning homer sealing their 15th win in 17 games last night. AL Central might finally be the division to watch this summer.
Detroit Tigers sitting at #1 in the power rankings is wild considering where they started the season. Can't remember the last time they were this dominant - probably been over a decade since they were considered the best team in baseball.
