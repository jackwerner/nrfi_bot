Phillies quietly building a dynasty with this nine-game win streak and taking over the top spot in the power rankings. The way they're pulling off these wild comebacks like Saturday against the A's shows this team has something special brewing.
Chris Sale just hit 2,500 strikeouts faster than any pitcher in MLB history. Getting to that mark in only 2,026 innings is absolutely ridiculous and shows how dominant he's been when healthy.
Junior Caminero went absolutely nuclear with six RBIs in that Rays blowout over Houston last night. When this kid gets locked in at the plate he transforms Tampa's offense into something completely different.
Skenes finally got some run support on his birthday and Pirates are playing looser lately. Feels like Pittsburgh might be turning a corner even if the trade rumors around their ace are already starting to swirl.
