Brad Keller signed a two-year, $22 million deal with the Phillies yesterday. Philly reshaping their bullpen after trading Matt Strahm to the Royals for Jonathan Bowlan on the same day.
Tyler Rogers heading to Toronto on a three-year deal after being one of baseball's most unique arms. Blue Jays now have both the highest release point (Yesavage) and lowest release point pitchers in MLB with nearly 6 feet separating them.
Adolis Garcia heading to Philadelphia on a one-year, $10 million deal. Phillies continue reshaping their roster after bringing back Schwarber while actively shopping Castellanos despite him having another year on his contract.

Michael King staying in San Diego on a three-year, $75 million deal with opt-outs after the first two seasons. Surprising move from the Padres who seemed likely to lose both King and Cease this offseason.
Michael King back with the Padres on a three-year, $75 million deal. Smart move by San Diego to lock him up after he showed what he can do as a full-time starter.
Munetaka Murakami signing a two-year, $34 million deal with the White Sox. The 25-year-old Japanese slugger didn't generate the same level of interest as past NPB stars but gets a chance to rebuild value before hitting the market
Pirates landed Brandon Lowe from Rays in that three-team deal with Houston. Much-needed offensive boost for a team that had only one player with a wRC+ above 101 last season. Smart move using their pitching depth to address their biggest weakness.
