Royals calling up 45-year-old Rich Hill for his 21st MLB season as they deal with rotation injuries. Ragans, Marsh, and Lorenzen all on IL. Amazing to see a pitcher still going strong at that age.
Mike Trout hitting .287/.432/.483 since returning from knee injury as full-time DH. Angels might keep him out of outfield permanently to preserve his health after years of leg problems.
A's rookie Nick Kurtz just had arguably the greatest offensive game in MLB history, going 6-for-6 with four home runs and eight RBIs against the Astros. First player ever with those numbers in a single game.

Luis Robert Jr. heating up for White Sox, batting .364 with a 1.023 OPS in 10 games since coming off IL. Trade interest growing despite his overall .206 average this season. Phillies, Mets, and Padres all potential landing spots before deadline.
Tigers have lost 11 of their last 12 games, falling from best record in baseball to a tight race with Astros and Blue Jays. Only 2.5 games separate these three AL teams now.
Yankees place Aaron Judge on injured list with flexor strain. Huge blow to their playoff push with the trade deadline just days away.
