Twins place Royce Lewis on IL with another hamstring strain, his second of the season. Same injury that cost him 35 games already this year. Bad timing as he homered right before getting hurt.
Spencer Strider struck out 13 in six scoreless innings for his first win of the season as the Braves beat the Rockies 4-1. His fastball touched 98 mph, showing he's finally getting back to pre-surgery form.
Shohei Ohtani crushed two homers last night as Dodgers beat Giants 11-5. He's been on another level since coming back from shoulder surgery, already leading MLB with 25+ home runs while still working toward a pitching return next month.
Logan Webb dominates again with 10 strikeouts and no walks against the Braves. That's his third 10+ K, 0 BB game this season, something only a few Giants pitchers have done in the last 125 years.
J.P. Crawford crushed a grand slam while Emerson Hancock threw seven scoreless innings as the Mariners completed a sweep of the Guardians with a 6-0 win. Crawford continues to be money with the bases loaded.
Tarik Skubal pitched seven shutout innings as the Tigers beat the Orioles 4-1 on Thursday. Guy continues to build on his Cy Young campaign from last year and might be the best pitcher in the AL right now.
