McNeil coming through with that clutch walk-off double in extras for the Mets last night is exactly the kind of spark they've needed. This team somehow finds ways to win these close games against division rivals when it matters most.
Judge hitting his 24th homer already and we're only in June is absolutely ridiculous. Guy's on pace to challenge the home run record if he stays healthy, which is the real question with his history.
Narv√°ez crushing that three-run homer against his former team in the Bronx is the kind of baseball story I live for. Guy spent almost a decade in the Yankees system only to come back and haunt them in a Red Sox uniform.
Rangers dropping 16 runs on the Twins last night is the kind of offensive outburst they've been missing all season. Carter finally heating up in June with that .389 average might be the spark this team needed to make a run.
Cal Raleigh hitting 11 homers in 17 games is the kind of power surge that makes you take notice, but the Mariners need to start winning if he's going to get any MVP consideration. Classic Seattle - incredible individual talent being wasted by inconsistent team performance.
Ohtani's getting ready to make his pitching debut for the Dodgers while still crushing it at the plate with an NL-leading 19 homers. Guy is somehow exceeding the impossible expectations we all had for him.
