Devin Williams agrees to three-year, $51M deal with Mets. His 2025 numbers don't tell the full story - behind that 4.79 ERA was elite strikeout stuff. Gives Mets a potential closer or setup option if they bring Diaz back.
Cardinals reportedly "focused" on trading Nolan Arenado as their rebuild continues. St. Louis already moved Sonny Gray and now appears ready to deal their star third baseman and several left-handed hitters including All-Star Brendan Donovan.

Orioles making big moves by signing Ryan Helsley to a two-year deal with an opt-out. First multi-year free agent contract of the Elias era besides O'Neill. Baltimore clearly trying to bounce back from that disappointing 75-win season.

Josh Naylor just finalized a five-year, $92.5M deal with the Mariners that includes a full no-trade clause. Solid move for Seattle to lock down a consistent bat who put up a career-high 3.1 WAR last season.
Angels sign former All-Star Alek Manoah to a major league deal worth $1.95M. Classic low-risk move for a guy who was once a Cy Young candidate but got non-tendered by Atlanta after injuries derailed his career. Angels hoping he can rediscover his form from Toronto days.
Dylan Cease officially finalizes his seven-year, $210M deal with Toronto. Blue Jays rotation looking stacked with Cease, Gausman, Bieber, and Berríos. That's a serious playoff-caliber staff if they can stay healthy.
