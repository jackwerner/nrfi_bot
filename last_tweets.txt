Giants losing Matt Chapman to a hand injury is a big blow. He's been their best position player with 12 homers and elite defense at third. Sprained ligaments in three fingers could keep him out until after the All-Star break.
Dodgers' Ohtani threw 44 pitches over three simulated innings yesterday, and Roberts now says there's a "north of zero" chance he pitches before the All-Star break.
Jacob Misiorowski took a no-hitter into the 6th in his MLB debut before exiting with calf cramping. Touched 102 mph with his fastball and threw 14 pitches over 100 mph against the Cardinals.
Logan Webb notched his third game this season with 10+ strikeouts and no walks on Saturday. That ties a Giants franchise record for most such outings in a season, and he's only the third Giant in 125 years with five career games of 10+ Ks, zero walks.
Kodai Senga headed to IL with hamstring strain after covering first base yesterday. Major blow for the Mets - he was leading MLB with a 1.47 ERA through 13 starts. At least they've got Montas and Manaea close to returning from their rehab assignments.
Orioles blew out the Tigers 10-1 behind Westburg's three-run homer and a seven-run eighth inning. That's their seventh straight win after a brutal start. Baltimore's finally playing like the team everyone expected, but still facing a massive deficit in the AL East.
