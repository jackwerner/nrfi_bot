Diamondbacks lose another key arm as closer Justin Martinez heads for Tommy John surgery. Second time he'll need the procedure since 2021, keeping him out until late 2026 at best.
Logan Webb just recorded his third 10+ strikeout, zero walk game of the season. That's already tied for the most by a Giants pitcher in the last 125 years, and we're only in June. Guy's adding K's without sacrificing his elite ground ball rate.
White Sox and Brewers swap Aaron Civale and Andrew Vaughn in a classic needs-based trade. Civale's pitched to a solid 3.32 ERA since returning from injury while Vaughn's struggled to a .189 average this season. Both teams betting on bounce backs.
Tarik Skubal dominating again with 7 shutout innings against Baltimore. Tigers ace looking like a Cy Young lock with his third straight gem.
Christian Moore went 0-for-3 in his MLB debut as Angels drop 2-0 to Orioles. Top prospect called up after just 79 minor league games.
Twins place Royce Lewis on IL with another hamstring strain, his second of the season. Same injury that cost him 35 games already this year. Bad timing as he homered right before getting hurt.
