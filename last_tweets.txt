Jo Adell going deep twice while the Angels erased a four-run deficit against Seattle is exactly why I keep watching this team. Guy's finally putting it all together after years of unfulfilled potential.
Max Fried's dominance with the Yankees is getting ridiculous - 7-0 with a 1.29 ERA through two months. Turns out giving the best pitcher in baseball a pinstriped jersey and unlimited run support might've been a smart move.
George Kirby hitting 500 career strikeouts while fanning 14 batters in seven innings yesterday is the kind of pitching dominance that makes baseball worth watching even during a long season.
Aaron Judge flirting with a .400 average while leading the AL in homers is just ridiculous. Guy's making the rest of the league look like they're playing a different sport.
Cal Raleigh quietly putting together an All-MLB caliber season with that .948 OPS and already halfway to last year's home run total. The Big Dumper's defensive game has leveled up too - elite in both blocking and framing metrics.
Phillies went from tied for first in the NL East to a five-game skid after Harper went down with that wrist inflammation again. Same injury that bothered him last season and now they're getting swept by the Pirates. Baseball can turn on you fast.
