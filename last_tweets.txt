Spencer Schwellenbach tossed his first career complete game yesterday as Braves beat Brewers 6-2. Nine Ks, no walks, and only five hits allowed. Dude's worked at least six innings in seven straight starts now.
Giants losing Matt Chapman to a hand injury is a big blow. He's been their best position player with 12 homers and elite defense at third. Sprained ligaments in three fingers could keep him out until after the All-Star break.
Dodgers' Ohtani threw 44 pitches over three simulated innings yesterday, and Roberts now says there's a "north of zero" chance he pitches before the All-Star break.
Jacob Misiorowski took a no-hitter into the 6th in his MLB debut before exiting with calf cramping. Touched 102 mph with his fastball and threw 14 pitches over 100 mph against the Cardinals.
Logan Webb notched his third game this season with 10+ strikeouts and no walks on Saturday. That ties a Giants franchise record for most such outings in a season, and he's only the third Giant in 125 years with five career games of 10+ Ks, zero walks.
Angels calling up Christian Moore, their top prospect, for his MLB debut against the Orioles. The 22-year-old second baseman was drafted 8th overall just last year and hit .279 with 5 homers in the minors. Another aggressive promotion from the Angels who've done the same with Neto and Schanuel.
