Bo Bichette won't return before playoffs with PCL sprain, but Blue Jays got encouraging news from second evaluation. He could resume baseball activities this week as Toronto looks to lock up the AL East with their magic number down to four.
Yordan Alvarez expected to miss significant time with left ankle sprain suffered Monday. Astros oddly not placing him on IL despite the severity. Tough blow for Houston's playoff push after he already missed chunks of the season with hand issues.
Phillies place Edmundo Sosa on 10-day IL with groin strain, call up 27-year-old Rafael Lantigua for his MLB debut after spending two and a half seasons at Triple-A without getting the call from Toronto.
Tarik Skubal injured in Tigers' loss to Marlins yesterday. Detroit's World Series aspirations now hanging in the balance as they await news on their ace. Sandy Alcantara outdueled him before the injury occurred.
Anthony Volpe playing through a partial labrum tear for the Yankees. Tough situation for the young shortstop but shows his commitment to the team during their playoff push.
Shohei Ohtani took a no-hitter deep and hit his 50th homer of the season against the Phillies, but the Dodgers still managed to lose. That's the kind of season it's been in LA despite his historic two-way campaign.
Cal Raleigh just hit his 56th homer, breaking Mickey Mantle's single-season record for switch hitters. One more and he'll stand alone above Griffey's back-to-back 56-homer seasons from the late 90s.
Lucas Giolito just 4 innings away from triggering his $19M mutual option with Boston. His turnaround makes him likely to decline and test free agency after being key to the Sox playoff push.
