Pirates making the Phillies look lost without Harper in the lineup. Five straight losses for Philly and now getting swept by a team nobody expected much from this season.
Ohtani hitting his MLB-leading 19th homer yesterday while prepping for his Dodgers pitching debut is just ridiculous. Guy's already dominating with a .648 slugging percentage and now he's about to be a two-way threat again.
Chris Sale ending the Braves' seven-game losing streak with 11 Ks against Milwaukee is exactly what Atlanta needed. Vintage Sale showing up when his team was desperate for a win.
Brewers finally calling up Misiorowski and his 103 mph heater is exactly what they need right now. Hard to believe a 23-year-old who throws that hard stayed in Triple-A this long when their rotation has been so inconsistent.
McNeil coming through with that clutch walk-off double in extras for the Mets last night is exactly the kind of spark they've needed. This team somehow finds ways to win these close games against division rivals when it matters most.
Judge hitting his 24th homer already and we're only in June is absolutely ridiculous. Guy's on pace to challenge the home run record if he stays healthy, which is the real question with his history.
