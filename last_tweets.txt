Ronald Acu√±a making his return with a 467-foot bomb on his first swing back is exactly the kind of drama baseball needs right now. Been almost a year since his ACL tear and he announces his presence like he never left.

Tigers shutting out Cleveland 5-0 yesterday is exactly why Detroit's been the biggest surprise in baseball this season. Their pitching staff has quietly become one of the most dominant in the league while nobody was paying attention.
Tarik Skubal just made the Guardians look completely helpless with that 13K shutout yesterday. When a pitcher is that dominant with just two hits allowed in a complete game, you have to wonder if we're watching a Cy Young campaign taking shape in Detroit.
