Gausman quietly dealing with 8 strong innings against Texas yesterday while Varsho provides the offense. Blue Jays pitching staff starting to find their rhythm at just the right time as we head into summer.
Rays finally hit .500 after demolishing the Blue Jays 13-0 to complete the sweep. Five straight wins and suddenly Tampa looks like the team everyone feared they could be when the season started.
Skubal throwing a 94-pitch shutout with 13 Ks and finishing with a 102.6 mph heater is absolutely ridiculous. Guy's taking his Cy Young defense to another level with performances most pitchers can only dream about.
Tyler Wade's mad dash home to win it in the 11th for the Padres wasn't your typical walk-off. Guy used his speed when it mattered most and San Diego needed every bit of it after that tense back-and-forth with Miami.
