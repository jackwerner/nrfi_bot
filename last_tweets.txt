Twins reportedly planning to keep Byron Buxton, Joe Ryan and Pablo López instead of trading them. Front office wants to build around the trio for 2026 rather than continue dismantling after dealing 10 players at last season's deadline.
Devin Williams is staying in New York, just not with the Yankees after signing a three-year, $51 million deal with the Mets. Rough season in the Bronx for the reliever, but Mets are banking on a bounce-back from the former All-Star.
Kyle Finnegan and the Tigers just agreed on a two-year, $19 million deal. Detroit keeps a key bullpen piece as they aim for a third straight playoff appearance.
Pete Alonso and the Orioles finalizing a five-year, $155 million deal. Baltimore adding serious power to their lineup after missing out on Schwarber. Orioles clearly pushing for a third straight playoff appearance with this move.
Mike Yastrzemski and the Braves finalize two-year, $23 million deal with a club option. Atlanta adds another outfield piece as they look to rebuild after last season's disappointment.
Gregory Soto just signed a one-year, $7.75M deal with the Pirates. Two-time All-Star reliever posted a 4.18 ERA with the Mets last season. Solid bullpen addition for Pittsburgh as they look to make some noise next year.
Yankees reportedly intensifying trade talks for Brewers starter Freddy Peralta. Multiple teams in the mix for the right-hander who posted solid numbers in 2025. Would be a significant rotation upgrade for any contender who lands him.
Braves just signed reliever Robert Suarez and designated Ryan Rolison for assignment to make room. Solid bullpen addition to pair with Raisel Iglesias who they already brought back on a one-year deal.
