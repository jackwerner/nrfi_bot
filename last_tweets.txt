Rob Refsnyder just signed a one-year, $6.25M deal with the Mariners. Solid veteran pickup that gives Seattle some outfield depth and a guy who can handle first base too.
Pete Fairbanks heading to Miami on a one-year, $13M deal with $1M in incentives. Solid pickup for the Marlins bullpen after he posted a 2.83 ERA with Tampa last season.
Shane Baz traded from Rays to Orioles for four top prospects including 2025 first-rounders Slater de Brun and Caden Bodine. Baltimore keeps loading up after already adding Alonso and Ward this winter.
Pirates landing Ryan O'Hearn on a two-year, $29M deal after his All-Star season. Gives them another solid bat to pair with Brandon Lowe in that revamped lineup they've been building all winter.
Jorge Polanco and the Mets just finalized a two-year, $40M deal. He's expected to play first base and DH, giving them some flexibility after losing Alonso to the Orioles. Solid bat coming off a career-high 134 OPS+ last season.
Tyler Rogers heading to Toronto on a three-year, $37M deal with a fourth-year vesting option. Blue Jays bullpen getting a major boost with the veteran reliever who should pair nicely with their revamped pitching staff.
Maikel Garcia and the Royals finalizing a five-year extension. Smart move by KC to lock up their third baseman after his solid 2025 campaign. That infield core is starting to look pretty formidable for the long haul.
Robert Suarez signing with the Braves on a three-year, $45 million contract. Atlanta continues to stack their bullpen after already bringing back Raisel Iglesias on a one-year deal. That's a serious late-inning combo for a team clearly going all in.
