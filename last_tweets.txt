Luis Robert Jr. heating up for White Sox, batting .364 with a 1.023 OPS in 10 games since coming off IL. Trade interest growing despite his overall .206 average this season. Phillies, Mets, and Padres all potential landing spots before deadline.
Tigers have lost 11 of their last 12 games, falling from best record in baseball to a tight race with Astros and Blue Jays. Only 2.5 games separate these three AL teams now.
Yankees place Aaron Judge on injured list with flexor strain. Huge blow to their playoff push with the trade deadline just days away.
Royals All-Star Kris Bubic placed on 15-day IL with rotator cuff strain. Huge blow to KC's playoff hopes that might force their hand on Seth Lugo trade talks. Bubic was having a career year before this setback.
Yankees place Aaron Judge on 10-day IL with right flexor strain. With the trade deadline approaching Thursday, New York needs the rest of the lineup to step up while their captain is sidelined at least two weeks.
Eugenio Suárez is making his case as the deadline's top bat with 36 homers and an .898 OPS. Tigers and Mariners both make sense with their third base holes, but D-backs asking for "a ton" in return.
Brewers and Rays finalizing deal to send catcher Danny Jansen to Milwaukee for prospect Jadher Areinamo. Rays covering about $2.7M of Jansen's remaining salary. Solid move for a Brewers team looking to strengthen their catching position.
Braves in serious trouble with all five Opening Day starters now on IL after Grant Holmes hits the shelf. That rotation of Holmes, Sale, Schwellenbach, Smith-Shawver and López is completely wiped out. Desperate times in Atlanta.
