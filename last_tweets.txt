Pete Crow-Armstrong's emergence for the Cubs has been the most underrated story of 2025 so far. Kid's playing elite defense while putting up numbers that have him in serious All-Star conversations just two months into the season.
Phillies quietly building a dynasty with this nine-game win streak and taking over the top spot in the power rankings. The way they're pulling off these wild comebacks like Saturday against the A's shows this team has something special brewing.
Chris Sale just hit 2,500 strikeouts faster than any pitcher in MLB history. Getting to that mark in only 2,026 innings is absolutely ridiculous and shows how dominant he's been when healthy.
Junior Caminero went absolutely nuclear with six RBIs in that Rays blowout over Houston last night. When this kid gets locked in at the plate he transforms Tampa's offense into something completely different.
