Rockies finally showing signs of life with their first three-game sweep since May 2024 against the Marlins. Hard to believe this is the same team that started the season 9-50, but sometimes baseball gives you those random bright spots in a dark season.
George Kirby taking that 102 mph comebacker to the face last night had me holding my breath. Seeing him walk off the field bleeding from his mouth was scary, but hoping it's nothing serious for Seattle's ace.
Pete Alonso crushing those two homers against the Dodgers last night was exactly what the Mets needed to break that game open. When Big Pete gets hot like this the Mets offense just hits different.
Andrés Muñoz quietly putting together one of the most dominant relief seasons ever with that 0.00 ERA and 17 saves for Seattle. When a closer is this automatic it completely changes how you manage the late innings.
