Aaron Judge flirting with a .400 average while leading the AL with 18 homers is just ridiculous. Guy makes superhuman performances look routine while the rest of us are still trying to process what we're seeing.
Skenes continues to be absolutely electric for the Pirates, making hitters look silly with that 2.36 ERA and 70 Ks. Yesterday's 10-1 dismantling of Arizona just confirms what we've been seeing - this kid is the real deal in his rookie campaign.
Cal Raleigh taking his game to another level for the Mariners this season is one of those developments that doesn't get enough attention. Guy has always had pop but now he's becoming the complete package behind the plate while Seattle quietly builds momentum.
Pirates absolutely dominated Arizona yesterday with that 10-1 win. Pretty surprising considering how their season's been going, but sometimes even struggling teams can put it all together for one night.
