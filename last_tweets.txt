Andrés Muñoz quietly putting together one of the most dominant relief seasons ever with that perfect 0.00 ERA through 23 appearances for Seattle. When a closer is this automatic it almost feels unfair to opposing teams in the ninth.
Ohtani getting ready to make his pitching debut for the Dodgers while already leading the NL with 19 homers is just ridiculous. Guy is about to be a two-way superstar for the defending champs and somehow it feels normal at this point.
Royals calling up Jac Caglianone less than a year after drafting him sixth overall is the kind of aggressive promotion baseball needs more of. Gotta respect a team in first place still looking to get better instead of manipulating service time.
Tarik Skubal just threw a "Maddux" with fewer than 100 pitches while striking out 13 batters, and his final pitch hit 102.6 mph. When a Cy Young winner is out here throwing the fastest pitch by a starter in the pitch-tracking era during a complete game shutout, you know we're witnessing something special.
