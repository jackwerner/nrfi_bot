Tatsuya Imai arriving in the US this week to meet with MLB teams. The 28-year-old Japanese pitcher posted a 1.92 ERA over 163 innings in NPB and should draw interest from most clubs hunting rotation help this winter.
Devin Williams agrees to three-year, $51M deal with Mets. His 2025 numbers don't tell the full story - behind that 4.79 ERA was elite strikeout stuff. Gives Mets a potential closer or setup option if they bring Diaz back.
Cardinals reportedly "focused" on trading Nolan Arenado as their rebuild continues. St. Louis already moved Sonny Gray and now appears ready to deal their star third baseman and several left-handed hitters including All-Star Brendan Donovan.
Cardinals reportedly shopping Nolan Arenado as St. Louis continues their roster overhaul. After already sending Sonny Gray to Boston, Arenado could be the next big name on the move with Brendan Donovan also drawing significant trade interest.

Josh Naylor just finalized a five-year, $92.5M deal with the Mariners that includes a full no-trade clause. Solid move for Seattle to lock down a consistent bat who put up a career-high 3.1 WAR last season.
