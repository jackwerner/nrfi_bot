Ohtani just hit his 23rd homer of the season and the guy's still finding ways to impact games even in a Mets win. Can't wait to see what he does when he finally takes the mound for the Dodgers after all this time.
Max Muncy coming through with two homers against the Mets last night and Freeman delivering the walk-off double in the 10th is peak Dodgers baseball. Those guys just have a flair for the dramatic in close games.
Rockies finally showing signs of life with their first three-game sweep since May 2024 against the Marlins. Hard to believe this is the same team that started the season 9-50, but sometimes baseball gives you those random bright spots in a dark season.
George Kirby taking that 102 mph comebacker to the face last night had me holding my breath. Seeing him walk off the field bleeding from his mouth was scary, but hoping it's nothing serious for Seattle's ace.
