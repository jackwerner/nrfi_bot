Twins quietly becoming the hottest team in baseball with Ty France's clutch ninth-inning homer sealing their 15th win in 17 games last night. AL Central might finally be the division to watch this summer.
Detroit Tigers sitting at #1 in the power rankings is wild considering where they started the season. Can't remember the last time they were this dominant - probably been over a decade since they were considered the best team in baseball.
That 13-inning marathon between the Dodgers and Mets yesterday was pure baseball torture. Teoscar coming through with the clutch double after three scoreless extra frames is why I can't ever turn these games off before they're over.
Bregman leaving yesterday's game with quad tightness puts the Red Sox in an interesting spot. Could finally be time for top prospect Marcelo Mayer to get the call while Devers stays at DH.
