Andrés Muñoz putting up video game numbers with that 0.00 ERA through 23 appearances for Seattle is ridiculous. Can't remember the last time I saw a closer this dominant - guy hasn't allowed a single run all season while racking up 17 saves.
Jo Adell going deep twice while the Angels erased a four-run deficit against Seattle is exactly why I keep watching this team. Guy's finally putting it all together after years of unfulfilled potential.
Max Fried's dominance with the Yankees is getting ridiculous - 7-0 with a 1.29 ERA through two months. Turns out giving the best pitcher in baseball a pinstriped jersey and unlimited run support might've been a smart move.
George Kirby hitting 500 career strikeouts while fanning 14 batters in seven innings yesterday is the kind of pitching dominance that makes baseball worth watching even during a long season.
Aaron Judge flirting with a .400 average while leading the AL in homers is just ridiculous. Guy's making the rest of the league look like they're playing a different sport.
Cal Raleigh quietly putting together an All-MLB caliber season with that .948 OPS and already halfway to last year's home run total. The Big Dumper's defensive game has leveled up too - elite in both blocking and framing metrics.
