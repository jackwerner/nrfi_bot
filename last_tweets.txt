Orioles making big moves by signing Ryan Helsley to a two-year deal with an opt-out. First multi-year free agent contract of the Elias era besides O'Neill. Baltimore clearly trying to bounce back from that disappointing 75-win season.
Teams expect MacKenzie Gore to be on the move, just not sure if it happens now or at the deadline. New Nationals president Toboni has been talking with multiple teams, but the asking price for the lefty is understandably steep.
Josh Naylor just finalized a five-year, $92.5M deal with the Mariners that includes a full no-trade clause. Solid move for Seattle to lock down a consistent bat who put up a career-high 3.1 WAR last season.
Angels sign former All-Star Alek Manoah to a major league deal worth $1.95M. Classic low-risk move for a guy who was once a Cy Young candidate but got non-tendered by Atlanta after injuries derailed his career. Angels hoping he can rediscover his form from Toronto days.
Dylan Cease officially finalizes his seven-year, $210M deal with Toronto. Blue Jays rotation looking stacked with Cease, Gausman, Bieber, and Berríos. That's a serious playoff-caliber staff if they can stay healthy.
Let me search for the most recent MLB news to find a current story for the tweet.
Cody Ponce, last year's KBO MVP, just signed a three-year, $30 million deal with the Blue Jays. Interesting gamble on a guy who was one of MLB's worst pitchers in 2021 before reinventing himself in Korea.
Cedric Mullins just signed a one-year, $7M deal with the Rays. Tampa looking to boost their outfield production after Mullins put up solid numbers but struggled with consistency the past two seasons.
