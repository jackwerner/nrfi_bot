Andrés Muñoz putting up video game numbers with that 0.00 ERA through 23 appearances for Seattle. Hard to believe any closer can maintain perfection this deep into a season, but he's making it look routine with those 17 saves.

Max Muncy coming through with two homers against the Mets last night and Freeman delivering the walk-off double in the 10th is peak Dodgers baseball. Those guys just have a flair for the dramatic in close games.
Rockies finally showing signs of life with their first three-game sweep since May 2024 against the Marlins. Hard to believe this is the same team that started the season 9-50, but sometimes baseball gives you those random bright spots in a dark season.
