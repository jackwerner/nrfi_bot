Chris Martin heading back to Texas on a one-year deal pending physical. First reliever the Rangers have brought back from their 2025 bullpen as they look to rebuild after trading Semien.
Angels bolster bullpen by signing Jordan Romano and Drew Pomeranz to one-year deals. Romano should slot in as the closer while Pomeranz provides a solid lefty option after pitching in Japan the past three seasons.
Kenley Jansen heading to Detroit on a one-year deal, giving the Tigers a formidable late-inning duo with Kyle Finnegan. Detroit's bullpen looking much stronger for 2026 after leading MLB in multi-inning relief appearances last season.
Pirates ink Davis Wendzel to minor league deal with spring training invite. Former Rangers infielder would make $850K in majors. Interesting depth move for a team that's been active in trade talks for middle infield help.
Nationals name 31-year-old Anirudh Kilambi as their new GM after his four-year stint as Phillies assistant GM. Interesting move as Washington continues revamping their front office with younger analytical minds.

Tyler Rogers heading to Toronto on a three-year, $37M deal with a vesting option for a fourth. Blue Jays bullpen looking serious after adding one of the game's most unique relievers.
John Means suffered an Achilles rupture while working out this week and underwent successful surgery yesterday. Former All-Star likely to miss the entire 2026 season, another devastating setback for a pitcher whose career has been derailed by injuries.
