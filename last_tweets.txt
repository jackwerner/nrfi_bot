Tarik Skubal just set the record for most strikeouts in a Maddux with 13 Ks against Cleveland. When a pitcher throws a complete game shutout under 100 pitches AND sets a record, you have to appreciate the artistry even if you're not a Tigers fan.
Juan Soto silencing the critics with that clutch hit against the Dodgers yesterday. New York media always overreacts to a minor slump from a superstar, but Soto's track record speaks for itself.
Rockies finally did something worth talking about by sweeping the Marlins - their first series sweep in over a year. Sometimes baseball gives you those random bright spots in an otherwise forgettable season.
Shane Bieber's comeback hitting another roadblock with that elbow soreness is tough to watch. Guy was finally getting close to returning after surgery and now has to be scratched from his rehab start - the mental grind of these setbacks must be brutal.
Burnes needing Tommy John is a brutal blow for the D-backs playoff hopes. Guy was their ace and now they're looking at a full season without him next year too. Starting to feel like every top pitcher is just one start away from TJ these days.
That D-backs comeback against Atlanta yesterday was something else. Down 10-4 in the ninth and somehow score seven runs to steal the win and complete the sweep. Baseball can be so cruel sometimes.
