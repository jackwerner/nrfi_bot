Yankees acquire Eugenio Suárez from Diamondbacks for two prospects. Third base was a major hole for them all season, and Suárez gives them some much needed pop at the hot corner for the stretch run.
Marlins' Edward Cabrera becoming more coveted than Alcantara on trade market despite elbow concerns. Teams see Sandy needing offseason to recover from Tommy John while Cabrera's posted solid 3.61 ERA with 86 Ks over 82 innings.
Dodgers reliever Tanner Scott headed for IL with forearm "sting sensation" after exiting Monday's game. Getting MRI today. Tough blow for LA's bullpen that's already had its share of struggles despite adding Scott and Yates in offseason.
Royals calling up 45-year-old Rich Hill for his 21st MLB season as they deal with rotation injuries. Ragans, Marsh, and Lorenzen all on IL. Amazing to see a pitcher still going strong at that age.
Mike Trout hitting .287/.432/.483 since returning from knee injury as full-time DH. Angels might keep him out of outfield permanently to preserve his health after years of leg problems.
A's rookie Nick Kurtz just had arguably the greatest offensive game in MLB history, going 6-for-6 with four home runs and eight RBIs against the Astros. First player ever with those numbers in a single game.

Luis Robert Jr. heating up for White Sox, batting .364 with a 1.023 OPS in 10 games since coming off IL. Trade interest growing despite his overall .206 average this season. Phillies, Mets, and Padres all potential landing spots before deadline.
