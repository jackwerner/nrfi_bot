Yankees starter Clarke Schmidt officially scheduled for Tommy John surgery tomorrow. Another blow to their rotation that's already missing Cole and Gil. Cashman confirmed adding a starter is now priority before July 31 deadline.
Alex Bregman set to return to Red Sox lineup tomorrow after hitting .299 with 11 homers before his injury. His career-high exit velocity numbers could give Boston's offense the boost they need after trading Devers.
Braves now 11 games under .500 and likely sellers at the deadline after losing two of their three best starters to injury. Chris Sale's dominant season (2.52 ERA, 114 Ks in 89.1 innings) before his rib injury makes him a potential trade chip despite earlier denials.

Jacob deGrom is dominating for Texas with the Rangers' offense struggling to provide run support. Guy's looking like his old Cy Young self while the team ranks 26th in runs scored. Classic deGrom situation.

Byron Buxton capped off one of the best games of his career with a homer to center, completing the first cycle of his MLB career in the Twins' 12-4 win over the Pirates. Guy's been showing why he's such a special talent when healthy.
