Mariners' Cal Raleigh just made history as the first catcher to win the Home Run Derby, edging Junior Caminero in the finals. Big Dumper's been on another level with an AL-record 38 homers before the break.
Charlie Morton's turned his season around after a brutal April start with Baltimore. Since returning to the rotation in late May, he's posted a 2.90 ERA with a 27% K rate over six starts. The 41-year-old still hitting 94-95 on his fastball.
Ryan O'Hearn went from Orioles' lone All-Star representative to potential trade chip in a matter of days. Baltimore's precarious playoff position has his name popping up in deadline rumors despite career-best numbers as DH.
Rangers first baseman Jake Burger landed on the 10-day IL with a left quad strain. Tough break for Texas, who's already struggling offensively at 26th in runs scored despite deGrom dominating on the mound.
Luis Robert Jr. back on the market two years after his 38-homer season. Still has elite speed and defense (+3 OAA this year) despite the hamstring issues. White Sox will be looking for a big return at the deadline.
Red Sox went from potential sellers to buyers after ripping off 10 straight wins before the break. Now sitting in second wild card position and back in the AL East race. Rotation help should be top priority with Buehler struggling.
Jacob deGrom looking like his old dominant self for the Rangers, posting All-Star numbers at 37 despite everyone writing him off after those injury-plagued seasons. Texas still needs offensive help though if they want to make a playoff push.
Astros targeting All-Star Brendan Donovan as their "prime" second base option before the deadline. Makes sense - Houston needs a lefty bat in that lineup as they look to maintain their AL West lead despite losing Tucker and Bregman.
