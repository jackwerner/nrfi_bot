Padres just made a blockbuster move getting Mason Miller and JP Sears from the A's. Had to give up Leo De Vries (No. 3 prospect in baseball) and three pitchers. Miller's 100mph heater could be a game-changer for their playoff push.
Astros making a stunning deadline move to bring Carlos Correa back from the Twins. He waived his no-trade clause to return to Houston where he won the 2017 World Series. Looks like they're going all-in for another championship run.
Carlos Correa waived his no-trade clause to return to Houston in a deadline stunner. Twins will cover $33 million of the $103.42 million remaining on his contract as Correa heads back to where he won his ring in 2017.
Dustin May headed to Red Sox in deadline deal. Former Dodgers World Series champ hasn't pitched in majors since April '24 but is nearing return from Tommy John surgery. Boston pushed hard to land the right-hander just before the deadline closed.
Carlos Correa moving to third base for the first time in his career after returning to Houston. Astros needed infield help with Paredes injured and Correa only waived his no-trade for them. Strange seeing him anywhere but shortstop.
Mariners quietly reunited with Eugenio Suarez from the Diamondbacks late Wednesday night. Seattle's lineup now looks formidable with Crawford, Rodriguez, Raleigh, Arozarena, Naylor and Suarez all in the mix.
Nick Kurtz tied the all-time record with 19 total bases in his four-homer game last week. Rookie's already making history and putting himself in the same conversation as Shawn Green's legendary 2002 performance.
Mariners went all in at the deadline, grabbing Eugenio Su√°rez and Josh Naylor without giving up any top 10 prospects. Dipoto finally got ownership to open the wallet after missing playoffs by one game the last two seasons. AL is wide open this year.
