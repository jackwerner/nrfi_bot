Pete Alonso and the Orioles finalizing a five-year, $155 million deal. Baltimore adding serious power to their lineup after missing out on Schwarber. Orioles clearly pushing for a third straight playoff appearance with this move.
Mike Yastrzemski and the Braves finalize two-year, $23 million deal with a club option. Atlanta adds another outfield piece as they look to rebuild after last season's disappointment.
Gregory Soto just signed a one-year, $7.75M deal with the Pirates. Two-time All-Star reliever posted a 4.18 ERA with the Mets last season. Solid bullpen addition for Pittsburgh as they look to make some noise next year.
Yankees reportedly intensifying trade talks for Brewers starter Freddy Peralta. Multiple teams in the mix for the right-hander who posted solid numbers in 2025. Would be a significant rotation upgrade for any contender who lands him.
Braves just signed reliever Robert Suarez and designated Ryan Rolison for assignment to make room. Solid bullpen addition to pair with Raisel Iglesias who they already brought back on a one-year deal.
Braves, Pirates, and Rockies all showing interest in Willi Castro. The former All-Star utility man struggled after being traded to the Cubs last season, hitting just .170 in 34 games. Still only 28, teams clearly value his defensive versatility.
Dodgers looking to move Glasnow despite his injury history. With Stone, Ryan, and Sheehan in their rotation depth, they're seeking an outfield bat in return. Guy's stuff is electric when healthy.
Marlins reportedly shopping Edward Cabrera with Orioles showing interest. Coming off a solid year with 3.53 ERA and 150 Ks, the 27-year-old could be Miami's most likely starter to move as they look to address offensive needs.
