Taylor Ward headed to Baltimore as Orioles trade former top prospect Grayson Rodriguez to Angels. Ward brings veteran outfield presence but O's giving up four years of team control for a rental with just one season left before free agency.
Raisel Iglesias signs one-year, $16 million deal with Angels after posting 1.25 ERA in second half of 2025. Still has elite stuff at 35 and should stabilize a bullpen that struggled with late leads last season.
Kazuma Okamoto and Kona Takahashi just got posted for MLB free agency, joining Munetaka Murakami and Tatsuya Imai from NPB. Four Japanese stars hitting the market at once is going to make this offseason way more interesting than expected.
Mets and Rangers just swapped Marcus Semien for Brandon Nimmo in a rare star-for-star trade. Rangers get their outfield upgrade while Mets fill that second base hole they've been trying to address since the deadline.
Cardinals trading Sonny Gray to Red Sox for Fitts and Clarke plus $20M cash. Gray finally agreed to waive his no-trade after saying in September he'd "definitely consider" trades as St. Louis leans into rebuilding. Makes sense for both sides.
Paul Skenes received a record $3.4 million from the pre-arbitration bonus pool after his dominant rookie season with the Pirates. Guy's getting paid before he even hits arbitration.
Phil Maton just signed with the Cubs, bringing his elite curveball to Chicago's bullpen. Guy thrived last season with nearly 12 Ks per nine despite barely touching 90 with his cutter.
Red Sox showing interest in J.T. Realmuto despite expectations he'll return to Philadelphia. Boston could use a catching upgrade but might need to redirect funds if they can't pull Realmuto from the Phillies after his decade-plus of consistent production.
