Pirates ink Davis Wendzel to minor league deal with spring training invite. Former Rangers infielder would make $850K in majors. Interesting depth move for a team that's been active in trade talks for middle infield help.
Nationals name 31-year-old Anirudh Kilambi as their new GM after his four-year stint as Phillies assistant GM. Interesting move as Washington continues revamping their front office with younger analytical minds.
Jorge Polanco and the Mets agree on a two-year, $40 million deal. Coming off a career-high 134 OPS+ last season, he'll likely split time between first base and DH as part of the post-Alonso plan in Queens.
Tyler Rogers heading to Toronto on a three-year, $37M deal with a vesting option for a fourth. Blue Jays bullpen looking serious after adding one of the game's most unique relievers.
John Means suffered an Achilles rupture while working out this week and underwent successful surgery yesterday. Former All-Star likely to miss the entire 2026 season, another devastating setback for a pitcher whose career has been derailed by injuries.
Brandon Lowe heading to Pittsburgh in a December trade. Pirates desperately needed power after hitting just 117 homers last season, 31 fewer than any other team. Lowe's 20+ HR potential should help that lineup.
Kelly put up decent numbers in Texas (4.23 ERA in 55 1/3 innings) but both sides were eyeing a reunion. He spoke fondly of Arizona during the Rangers' visit to Chase Field in the season's final weeks.
Rays shipped Shane Baz to Baltimore for multiple top-30 prospects and a 2026 draft pick. Orioles loading up with Baz, Alonso, Ward and Helsley acquisitions as they look to bounce back from a rough 2025 season.
