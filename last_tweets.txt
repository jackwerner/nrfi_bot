That D-backs comeback against Atlanta yesterday was something else. Down 10-4 in the ninth and somehow score seven runs to steal the win and complete the sweep. Baseball can be so cruel sometimes.
Kyle Hendricks finally got his 100th career win last night with the Angels. Pretty cool seeing a guy who's never thrown harder than 90mph survive this long in the league while everyone else is pumping 98+.
Craig Kimbrel coming back to Atlanta feels like a full circle moment. Braves bullpen has been struggling lately so bringing back their former closer makes sense, but gotta wonder how much the 37-year-old has left in the tank at this point.
Tarik Skubal throwing a "Maddux" with his final pitch clocked at 102.6 mph is just ridiculous. Dude struck out 13 while needing fewer than 100 pitches for a complete game shutout - that's the kind of pitching performance that makes you stop and appreciate what you're watching.
Andrés Muñoz putting up video game numbers with that 0.00 ERA through 23 appearances for Seattle is ridiculous. Can't remember the last time I saw a closer this dominant - guy hasn't allowed a single run all season while racking up 17 saves.
Jo Adell going deep twice while the Angels erased a four-run deficit against Seattle is exactly why I keep watching this team. Guy's finally putting it all together after years of unfulfilled potential.
