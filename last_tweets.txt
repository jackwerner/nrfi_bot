Spencer Schwellenbach tossed his first career complete game yesterday as Braves beat Brewers 6-2. Nine Ks, no walks, and only five hits allowed. Dude's worked at least six innings in seven straight starts now. Is he developing into Atlanta's new ace?
Giants losing Matt Chapman to a hand injury is a big blow. He's been their best position player with 12 homers and elite defense at third. Sprained ligaments in three fingers could keep him out until after the All-Star break. Can Casey Schmitt step up at the hot corner?
